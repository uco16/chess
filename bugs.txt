- on V's laptop (all browsers, even when U hosts): white player always connects properly but black player does not connect sometimes (not known when)
DONE: issue was that the second client received the "match" from the server before defining what to do on 'match' (ie before socket.on('match') was run in sketch.js).
Issue was fixed by emitting a 'readyToMatch' after socket.on('match') on client-side. The server then allows the socket to join queue only once 'readyToMatch' is received.
